Regression Test with WebDriver 
==========

Automated browser-based regression testing with Selenium and the WebDriver API helps to ensure that code changes don't break the builds. 
Multiple language bindings are supported for use with Selenium, so once the framework was installed, we chose Java to write our tests in. 

Getting Started
====================

1. Download and install Java in your system.  Click [here] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) to download Java and install it in your system as per given installation guide over there.

2. Download and install an IDE such as NetBeans or Eclipse

3. Download WebDriver Files depending on the language bindings of choice. [Here] (http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/)

4. Open the IDE and add the webdriver .jar files to the system path

5. Download a browser driver such as [ChromeDriver] (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
